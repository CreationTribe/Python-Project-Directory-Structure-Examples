This is pretty straightforward: everything is in the same directory. The files shown here are not necessarily
exhaustive, but I recommend keeping the number of files to a minimum if you plan on using a basic layout like this.
 Some of these files will be new to you, so let’s take a quick look at what each of them does.

.gitignore: This is a file that tells Git which kinds of files to ignore, like IDE clutter or local configuration
files. Our Git tutorial has all the details, and you can find sample .gitignore files for Python projects here.

helloworld.py: This is the script that you’re distributing. As far as naming the main script file goes, I recommend
that you go with the name of your project (which is the same as the name of the top-level directory).

LICENSE: This plaintext file describes the license you’re using for a project. It’s always a good idea to have one if
 you’re distributing code. The filename is in all caps by convention.

Note: Need help selecting a license for your project? Check out ChooseALicense.

README.md: This is a Markdown (or reStructuredText) file documenting the purpose and usage of your application.
Crafting a good README is an art, but you can find a shortcut to mastery here.

requirements.txt: This file defines outside Python dependencies and their versions for your application.

setup.py: This file can also be used to define dependencies, but it really shines for other work that needs to be done
 during installation. You can read more about both setup.py and requirements.txt in our guide to Pipenv.

tests.py: This script houses your tests, if you have any. You should have some.
